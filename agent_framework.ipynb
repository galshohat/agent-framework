    "The **Microsoft Agent Framework** is a Python SDK for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows. It provides a unified interface for creating intelligent systems that can reason, take actions, and collaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "- Single and multi-agent orchestration\n",
    "- Tool integration and function calling\n",
    "- Memory and context management\n",
    "- Workflow patterns (sequential, parallel, branching)\n",
    "- Built-in observability and middleware\n",
