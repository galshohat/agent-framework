    "# Microsoft Agent Framework - Learning Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This notebook is designed to explore all the capabilities of the Microsoft Agent Framework for learning and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Microsoft Agent Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Agent Framework is an **open-source development kit** for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows for .NET and Python. It brings together and extends ideas from **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen** projects, combining their strengths while adding new capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **AI Agents** | Individual agents that use LLMs to process user inputs, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses |\n",
    "| **Workflows** | Graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework provides foundational components:\n",
    "- **Model Clients** - Chat completions and responses (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Azure AI)\n",
    "- **Agent Session** - State management for conversations\n",
    "- **Context Providers** - Agent memory capabilities\n",
    "- **Middleware** - Intercepting agent actions\n",
    "- **MCP Clients** - Tool integration via Model Context Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents excel at:\n",
    "- 🎧 **Customer Support** - Multi-modal queries with tool lookups\n",
    "- 📚 **Education & Tutoring** - Personalized learning with knowledge bases\n",
    "- 💻 **Code Generation** - Implementation, reviews, and debugging\n",
    "- 🔬 **Research Assistance** - Web search, document summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "### When NOT to Use AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"If you can write a function to handle the task, do that instead of using an AI agent.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid agents for:\n",
    "- Highly structured tasks with predefined rules\n",
    "- Well-defined sequences of operations\n",
    "- Tasks requiring more than ~20 tools (use workflows instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Azure subscription** with access to Azure OpenAI\n",
    "2. ✅ **Azure OpenAI resource** with a deployed model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)\n",
    "3. ✅ **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated (`az login`)\n",
    "4. ✅ **`.env` file** with your configuration (see README.md)"
